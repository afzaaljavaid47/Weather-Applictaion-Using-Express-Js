## Abstract

This project is a weather application built using Express JS. It allows users to get current weather information for any city using data fetched from a weather API. The application features a simple and user-friendly interface where users can enter a city name and retrieve real-time weather data. The primary objective of this project is to provide an easy-to-use tool for accessing weather information.

## Introduction

The Weather Application is designed to provide users with up-to-date weather information for any city. Built with Express JS, a fast and minimalist web framework for Node.js, this project demonstrates the use of server-side JavaScript to handle API requests and serve content. The application fetches weather data from an external API and displays it to the user in a clean and straightforward interface. This project highlights essential web development practices such as routing, middleware, and API integration.

### Features

- Fetches and displays current weather information for any city.
- User-friendly interface for entering city names and viewing weather data.
- Provides details such as temperature, weather conditions, and humidity.
- Implements error handling for invalid city names or API issues.
- Demonstrates server-side development with Express JS.

## Tools and Techniques

This project utilizes several tools and techniques to build a robust and efficient weather application:

- **Express JS**: A web framework for Node.js that simplifies server-side development.
- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime that allows for server-side execution of JavaScript.
- **Axios**: A promise-based HTTP client for making API requests to fetch weather data.
- **OpenWeatherMap API**: A weather API used to retrieve current weather information.
- **EJS (Embedded JavaScript)**: A templating engine for generating HTML markup with JavaScript.
- **Middleware**: Express middleware for handling requests, errors, and static files.
- **CSS**: For styling the application interface.
- **ESLint and Prettier**: Tools for maintaining code quality and formatting.
- **Git and GitHub**: Version control and collaboration platform.

By combining these tools and techniques, the Weather Application provides a comprehensive and practical approach to building server-side applications with real-time data fetching.
